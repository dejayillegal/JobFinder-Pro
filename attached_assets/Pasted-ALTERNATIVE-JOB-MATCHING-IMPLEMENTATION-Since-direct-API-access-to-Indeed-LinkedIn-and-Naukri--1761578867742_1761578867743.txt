ALTERNATIVE JOB MATCHING IMPLEMENTATION:
   Since direct API access to Indeed, LinkedIn, and Naukri may be limited or expensive, implement these alternative approaches:
   
   a) Web Scraping Alternative:
      - Use Playwright or Selenium for dynamic scraping
      - Implement rate limiting and rotation strategies
      - Add job data caching with Redis/PostgreSQL
      - Create scheduled background tasks with Celery or APScheduler
   
   b) RSS/Atom Feed Parsing:
      - Parse publicly available job feeds
      - Implement feed aggregation from multiple sources
   
   c) Third-party Aggregation Services:
      - Integrate with JobsPikr, Adzuna API, or RapidAPI job search endpoints
      - Use free tiers for development/testing
   
   d) Job Matching Algorithm:
      - Implement TF-IDF or sentence transformers for resume-job matching
      - Use spaCy for skill extraction from resumes and job descriptions
      - Create a similarity scoring system based on:
        * Skills match (weighted highest)
        * Experience level match
        * Location preference
        * Job title relevance
      - Store embeddings in vector database (FAISS or Pinecone)

3. DATABASE MIGRATION FIX:
   - Update alembic/env.py to handle settings initialization gracefully
   - Add try-except blocks around settings import
   - Ensure .env file has all required variables with default values

4. CODE STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Create separate service classes for each job source
   - Implement abstract base class for job scrapers
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Create async endpoints for job fetching
   - Implement job deduplication logic

5. TESTING:
   - Add unit tests for settings validation
   - Create mock API responses for testing
   - Test Alembic migrations independently

DELIVERABLES:
- Fixed config.py with proper Pydantic settings configuration
- Updated .env.example with all required variables
- New job scraping service implementation (at least 2 alternative sources)
- Resume-job matching algorithm with similarity scoring
- Updated database models for job storage
- Working Alembic migration files
- API endpoints for job search and matching
- Documentation for setup and deployment

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maintain compatibility with Python 3.11+
- Use FastAPI best practices
- Follow async/await patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Add rate limiting for external requests
- Ensure GDPR/data privacy compliance for job data storage

Start by fixing the immediate Pydantic error, then implement the alternative job matching system.
